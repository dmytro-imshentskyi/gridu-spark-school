Hello! 
This is my pet project for boosting knowledge and experience in BigData and Spark API.

Practical task is here: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihded5qAWkffR0UvPJ5JolwaKOFijpkkT7_vB_EtlZI/edit

All sub-tasks have been completed with using Spark SQL on top of DataFrame API.  
Project contains only 3 files:
- apple.package contains domain class Event
- ClickStreamData is a objects with test data
- ClickStreamAnalyzer is a driver program 

To kick off Spark application, please import project as SBT file and run ClickStreamAnalyzer main class.
